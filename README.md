# 📊 Fama-French 3-Factor Strategies Backtesting Dashboard

An interactive Python web dashboard for exploring, backtesting, and visualizing **Fama-French 3-Factor** equity investment strategies across time, sectors, and regions.

---

## 🧠 Overview

This tool allows users to:
- Construct long/short portfolios based on **Size (SMB)**, **Value (HML)**, and **Market (MKT)** factors.
- Perform **historical backtesting** of each factor individually or in combination.
- Visualize performance, risk metrics, and factor exposures over time.
- Interactively adjust parameters (e.g., rebalance frequency, ranking percentile, region).

---

## 🧮 Fama-French 3-Factor Model

\[
R_i - R_f = \alpha + \beta_{MKT}(R_m - R_f) + \beta_{SMB} \cdot \text{SMB} + \beta_{HML} \cdot \text{HML} + \epsilon
\]

Where:
- \(R_i\): Asset return
- \(R_f\): Risk-free rate
- \(R_m\): Market return
- **SMB**: Small minus big (Size effect)
- **HML**: High minus low (Value effect)

## 🚀 Key Features

- 📈 **Factor Portfolio Construction**: Build portfolios based on FF3 characteristics (size/value).
- 🧪 **Backtesting Engine**: Supports rolling rebalancing and out-of-sample evaluation.
- 📊 **Interactive Dashboard**:

  - Factor exposure analysis (regression on FF3)
  - Compare factor-based portfolios with market and equal-weighted benchmarks
- 🔧 **Custom Settings**:
  - Rebalancing frequency (monthly, quarterly)
  - Factor ranking thresholds (e.g., top 30% value)
  - Investment universe filters (e.g., S&P 500, Russell 1000)
